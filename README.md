# calendar facts

Dear gods of geekdom this is fugly.
But it is my first "totally from scratch" crystal script. I learned all about arrays, appending said arrays, getting samples and other fun
things.  

Inspired by xkcd #1930 - [Calendar Facts](https://www.xkcd.com/1930/)

# Did you know that [a recurring event] [occurs in an unusual manner]
# because of [phenomena or political decisions]? Apparently [wild card statement]."
# While it may seem like trivia, it [trivia]
